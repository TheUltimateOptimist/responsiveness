A minimal, easy to use responsive framework for building UI for all screen sizes using the [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) breakpoints.

## Background

When I was first given the task to develop a flutter application for all screen sizes I was overwhelmed and clueless. Even though flutter provides widgets like ```LayoutBuilder``` or ```MediaQuery``` to enable responsive UI development, I found making use of those widgets in an easy, readable, predictable manner quite difficult.<br>
Because you still need to figure out:<br>
- What brekpoints you want to use
- How to identify the current breakpoint given the screen width
- How to define a UI based on the current breakpoint in an easy, readable manner

This package is the result of me trying to answer the above mentioned questions and offers thereby an oppionated approach to developing responsive UI using flutter.
